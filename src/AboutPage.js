        <p>I am a fullstack software engineer studying at Rithm School. </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prior to transitioning to tech I was a music teacher and band
          director. My love of organization, problem solving, and growth mindset
          led me to study programming.{' '}

        <br />
        <p>
          When not coding you can find me hiking with my family, building Lego,
          or making gluten free banana pancakes.{' '}
